# Koptional — Minimalistic `Optional` type for Kotlin

> We don't think that Kotlin itself needs `Optional` because it has strong
> `null`-safe type system that effectively eliminates need in such a wrapper.
> However there are Java APIs and libraries like [RxJava 2][rxjava2] which don't accept `null` values
> and language-level nullability cannot help with that.

> We also think that in many cases you can use `sealed class`es to express absent values,
> however in simple cases like passing `String?` through RxJava stream `Optional` is a more convenient solution.

The goal of this implementation is to be convenient to use and fit Kotlin's `null`-safe type system, which resulted in:

* Only two functions: `toOptional()` and `toNullable()`.
  * Mimics Kotlin functions like `toInt()` and `toBoolean()`.
* `Some` and `None` are declared as **top level types**.
  * No need to write `Optional.Some` or `Optional.None`.
* No functions like `map()`, `getOrElse()`, `filter()`, etc.
  * Use `toNullable()` and Kotlin `stdlib` functions like `let()`, `takeIf()` instead.

## Usage

### Create

```kotlin
val some = Some(value)
val none = None // It's an object!
```

### Convert

```kotlin
// T? → Optional<T>
// If value is null — you'll get None, otherwise you'll get Some(value).
val o = value.toOptional()

// Optional<T> → T?
// If optional is None — you'll get null, otherwise you'll get non-null T value.
val t = optional.toNullable()
```

### Leverage Kotlin Features

#### Fallback from `None` (like `java.util.Optional.getOrElse()`)

```kotlin
val f = optional.toNullable() ?: "fallback"
```
#### Use [Smart Cast](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/typecasts.html#smart-casts)

```kotlin
when (optional) {
    is Some -> println(optional.value)
    is None -> println("Nope!")
}
```

#### Use [Destructuring](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multi-declarations.html)

```kotlin
// If Optional is None — you'll get null, otherwise you'll get non-null T value.
val (value) = optional
```

### Interop with Java

Use the static `Optional.toOptional()` to wrap an instance of `T` into `Optional<T>`.

### Work with RxJava 2

```kotlin
val values = Observable.just(Some("a"), None, Some("b"))

// Filter Some values.
values
    .filterSome()
    .test()
    .assertValues("a", "b")

// Filter None values.
values
    .filterNone()
    .test()
    .assertValues(Unit) // filterNone() maps None to Unit.
```
